	<h1>Time,Space,Complexity</h1>
	<p>
Efficient algorithms have lower time complexity, with O(1) being the most efficient and O(n!) being the least. Choosing algorithms with lower time complexity is crucial for handling larger datasets more quickly.</p>
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> measures the amount of memory an algorithm uses; O(1) signifies constant space (independent of input size), while O(n) indicates linear space (proportional to input size).</p>
